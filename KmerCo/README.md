# KmerCo: A lightweight K-mer counting technique with a tiny memory footprint

## Abstract
----------------
K-mer counting is a requisite process for DNA assembly because it speeds up its overall process. The frequency of K-mers is used for estimating the parameters of DNA assembly, error correction, etc. The process also provides a list of district K-mers which assist in searching large databases and reducing the size of de Bruijn graphs. Nonetheless, K-mer counting is a data and compute-intensive process. Hence, it is crucial to implement a proficient data structure that occupies low memory but does fast processing of K-mers. We proposed a K-mer counting technique, called KmerCo that implements a potent counting Bloom Filter called countBF. KmerCo has two phases: insertion and classification. The insertion phase inserts all K-mers into countBF and determines distinct K-mers. The classification phase is responsible for the classification of distinct K-mers into trustworthy and erroneous K-mers based on user-provided threshold values. The output of KmerCo is countBF containing all mapped K-mers and three files containing a list of distinct, trustworthy, and erroneous K-mers. We also proposed a novel benchmark performance metric. We used the Hadoop word count program to determine the frequency of K-mers. We have conducted rigorous experiments to prove the dominion of KmerCo compared to state-of-the-art K-mer counting techniques. The experiments are conducted using DNA sequences of four organisms. The datasets are pruned to generate four different size datasets. KmerCo is compared with Squeakr, BFCounter, and Jellyfish. KmerCo took the lowest memory and the inserted to ignore K-mer ratio is zero. Furthermore, KmerCo has the highest number of insertions per second and a positive trustworthy rate. 

## Programming Language: C

### Executing and Running Code
----------------------------

#### Preparing the input file

Retrieve sequences into a text file

```$ awk '{if(NR%4==2)print $0}' dataset.fastq > sequence.txt```

Concatenating all DNA sequences into a single line

```$ sed -i ':a; N; s/\\n/ /; ta' sequence.txt```

#### Compiling

```$ gcc KmerCo.c -o KmerCo -lm```

#### Executing

```$ ./KmerCo -K 28 -eta 5 -h 1 sequence.txt```


SYNOPSIS

        ./KmerCo [-K <K-mer length>] [-eta <threshold>] [-h <#hash()>] -o <out-file> <files>...

OPTIONS

        <K-mer length>    length of K-mers (default = 28)
        <threshold>    Classification of distinct K-mers between trustworthy and erroneous based on this value (default = 5)
			Distinct K-mers: 

        <#hash()> Number of hash functions for the countBF



Note:
1. Trustworthy K-mer: Distinct K-mer having frequncy more than threshold value.
Erroneous K-mer: Disticnt K-mer having frequncy less than or euqal to threshold value.
2. Default countBF counter length=8
3. If changing the countBF counter length include the corresponding mask header file.
4. KmerCo considers canonical K-mers (Refer the paper for defination)
