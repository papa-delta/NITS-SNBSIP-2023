# lighter-kmerco

This repository is built to house our code for the embedding of LIGHTER with KmerCo using RobustBF.

This project is undertaken by us as part of our summer internship at National Institue of Technology Silchar.

## This is a work in progress (made public temporarily)!

We're still working on some minor changes (code refactoring, etc.) and will release everything properly once done.
